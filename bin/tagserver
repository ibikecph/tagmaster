# TAGP receiver/distributor for use with TagMaster RFID readers.
# The antennas/readers connect to the server via TCP and the TAGP protocol and transmits events as they happen.
# The server then queues the events and passes them to a separate receiver.

# There is a problem with lost connections that causes more and more sockets to be left open.
# Eventurally this results in the script failing. A workaround is to restart the script regularly, like once a day.

# Number of open files can be checked using;
# pa aux                # find process
# lsof -p 667           # show open files
# lsof -p 667 | wc -l   # count open files
