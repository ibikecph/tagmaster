# TAGP scanner for use with TagMaster RFID readers.
# The antennas/readers connect to the server via TCP and the TAGP protocol and transmits events as they happen.
# The script looks for unique tag ID's and shows them as they're found.
# It will also save the list of tags to a file.

# There is a problem with lost connections that causes more and more sockets to be left open.
# Eventurally this results in the script failing. A workaround is to restart the script regularly, like once a day.

# Number of open files can be checked using;
# pa aux                # find process
# lsof -p 667           # show open files
# lsof -p 667 | wc -l   # count open files
